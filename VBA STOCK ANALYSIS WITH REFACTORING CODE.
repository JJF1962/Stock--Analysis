# Project Overview Visual Basic Stock Analysis
  *The project purpose is to resolve the challenges for Module number 2,  Visual Basic for Aplications or VBA, that is a programing language for Microsoft Office applications,
  allowing to add more analytical power to Excel. More especifically, it consist in to edit or refactor a code solution provided in the original VBA stock Analysis
  for the years 2017 and 2018, with the objective to add new functionality, aplied several codification steps learned in this Module 2,  improve the logic of the code, less memory utilization and easier read
  ##  Performing Analysis.
  * To perform the Analysis, I will go first over the VBA Module 2 class purpose, analysis, challenges and conclusion, as detailed as follows:
### Class Purpose
  * The class purpose was to cover and teach the fundamentals building blocks of programming, learn to code and how to deconstruct a problem and translate the solution into
  instructions and start to be expose and thinking to programatically analize data, the first thing that we learned that VBA was invented in the 1960s to help teacch programing 
  concept, and started to be used a s full fledge programming language in the 1990, , called today VBA or VB.NET.
  * Secondly we learned how to enable the developer tools for Mac and Windows, in my case, that by defaut is not eanable to protect users and computer from malicius virus, I 
  focuesd on windows, therefore following the video instructions I went to File, selected Excel options, delected customized ribbon, and I enabled the developer tab, after close, I saw the developer option enable in the tool bar, Permitting to learn and execute this challenge using Visual Basic and Macro tools. Aditionally we learned that the extension is xlsm,  we must only open files from trusted sources.
  Thirdly we downloaded the  excel file green_stocks.xlsx, but offcourse, we must save the file with other extension (xlsm extension) as mentioned before, forcing us to enable themacros, and we have a new file with an icon i in the excel logo, to protect users to open it if they dont know the source, because might contain a virus. Aditionally we startedto learned coding, creating sub routine "sub", how to check is the macro operate with Sub MacroCheck(), the system automatically add End sub, if important to note that all codemust be writte between the subroutine and End Sub. Furthermore we went over the data types such as long, double, string and boolean, measurement of memory, how to create 
 variables such as Dim, work with worsheets, cells, Range, readability and understand that all mark in green are notes or names for future refernece that no consume space of
 memory, whitspace, Loops (for) and paterns initialize a variable to hold a sum, set the variable to zero, start a for loop, use a conditional to increase the sum variable by 
 value and End the loop, also the Anti-patters. Logical operators (both, either or opposite), comparison operators 9<>) conditionals, array, nested loops
 Fourtly we leraned the research sites such as Official documentation (Microsoft), Stack Overflow, Quora and Expert Blog Posts and how to obtain help or potential solutions to 
 programatic code issues. 
 Finally, we learned how to work with reuse code, that is very commun and probably part of our regular job, and specifically used as very good guide to reponse the module challenge, refactoring and creating the code used ine response and calculate the values for All Stock 2018. as well as Static Formatting to add the font and borders, automatically fit columns widths and conditional formatting for the colors, create a button, the clear buttom and run the macro, add the start and end time to see the perfornace of the code.and how to disply it.
   * As required in the previous module work with Git Hub an update worksheets, pictures and writte the README.md 
### Challenges & Run Stock Analysis
   * Challenges: To respond the challenges I created a code (attached), based on the challenge_starter_code, and I refactored using canvas section 2.3.3 Reuse a code, and I followed the examples for the stock analysis 2018 issued in Canvas in the mentioned section, I made changes such as  the year ranges, as indicated in the provide code and google it. Also, I used the following section in Canvas for conditionals, array, formatting and create the button, the button was very simple to create, the challenge was to create the clear button, that required to google and discuss it with classmates via slack. It was challenging and frustrating because during the process I had a sintaxis errors, or I was not in the sheet and recived continues error messages, or Im not properly interpretated the sintaxis amd logic of it.but now, I fell that supported with the classes, that also I double watched usin the recorded classes and talk with Tutor allow me to present the Stock analysis as follows: 
   * StockAnalysis: The results of the refactory stock analysis for the years 2017 and 2018 are presented as follows
